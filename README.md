# The pokedex version 2 #
## personal project ##

More clean and faster version of my pokedex project.
A redo done because I was not happy about the speed and layout of my previous pokedex.

In order to speed up the display of the cards by a whole lot I made a separate program that gathers
all the needed information from all the fetch requests sent to the pokiapi while adding them all together in a single
json file.
